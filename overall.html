            <h2>Overall NYC Tree Report</h2>
            <p>The data collected in the two most recent iterations of the Tree Census are unfortunately largely incompatible. For example, while the 2015 survey collected data on whether a tree was alive, dead, or a stump, the 2005 tree census measured tree health on a scale of poor to excellent, without defining each increment. In order to provide a quick and easy overview of the city's tree population, we have chosen to focus the overall report on the 2015 data, which is more complete and specific. Where possible we have included comparisons between the 2015 and 2005 data.</p>
            <p>Below, we've compiled fast facts, interesting tidbits, and leaderboards to see which neighborhoods in New York have the most and the healthiest trees, and which species are most prevalent and rare.</p>

        <h3>Tree Health</h3>
            <p>In 2015, the Tree Census volunteers counted 683,788 trees. According to the New York City government, the estimated population of the city was 8,550,405 people. That's a ratio of 13 people for every tree counted. Of those trees, we've broken them down by health in the table below:</p>
             <table style="border-collapse:collapse;">
                <tr><th>Tree Health</th><th>Count of Trees</th><th>Percent of Total</th></tr>
                 <tr><td>Living Trees</td><td>652,173</td><td>95.4%</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Dead Trees</td><td>13,961</td><td>2%</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Tree Stumps</td><td>17,654</td><td>2.4%</td></tr>

            <h3>Species Breakdown</h3>
            <p>In 2015, the number of trees per species varied widely in New York City. Below, see the most and least common species.</p>
            <h4>Most Common Trees</h4>
            <ol><li>London Planetree (87,014)</li>

            <h3>Neighborhood Leaderboard</h3>
            <p>A few neighborhoods emerged as clear leaders for tree health and population. While it's unclear whether these neighborhoods had the most conscientious volunteers, the largest land area, or truly have more trees per square foot than others, the data shows their trees are thriving.</p>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Fun Fact: East New York was also among the neighborhoods with the greatest tree diversity. The census reports a total of 117 tree species that were found in East New York, making it the fourth most diverse tree population in all of New York City.</p>
