            <h2>Why Trees Count</h2>
            <p><span id="para1">Attention tree lovers, New Yorkers, and New York tree lovers! Did you know that we're currently in the midst of a once-in-a-decade event? NYC Parks is conducting the 2025 Tree Census, with the goal of counting every tree in the city. This is a massive undertaking that enlists thousands of volunteers to record the location, species, dimensions, and health of every tree across all five boroughs. The first tree census took place in 1995 and revealed that there were over 10,000 dead street trees in New York and 498,470 trees in total.<sup><a href="#source1">1</a></sup> According to the last tree census in 2015, New York City was home to over 800,000 trees.<sup><a href="#source2">2</a></sup> Up to that point, only street trees were included in the census. A separate inventory in 2017-2018 added park trees to the count for the first time, and the 2025 census will also include park trees.</span></p>
            <p><span id="para2">So what is the point of counting every tree in New York? It gives the Parks Department a better understanding of our urban forest. They use the data collected in the census to find out which neighborhoods have room for more trees, so that canopy coverage is expanded equitably.<sup><a href="#source3">3</a></sup> Urban forests have numerous benefits, especially in a huge city like New York. They give us shade in the summer, save us money on heating by acting as windbreaks in the winter, and absorb carbon dioxide year-round.<sup><a href="#source4">4</a></sup> Trees also help cut down air and water pollution, intercepting all sorts of detrimental gases and particles that would otherwise enter our lungs and environment.</span></p>
            <p>All of the existing tree census data is available through <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh/about_data">NYC Open Data</a> and we think that there's plenty of interesting information in those datasets that you should be aware of, even if you don't work for the Parks Department! We've put together an <a href="overall.html">Overall Report</a> on trees in NYC with some of the most interesting facts and data from the latest census. To find out more about trees in your neighborhood, take a look at our <a href="neighborhood.html">Neighborhood Tree Report</a>. If you're interested in learning more about the history of the Tree Census, check out the <a href="about.html">About</a> page. And before you go, see how much carbon dioxide a tree can absorb in one year using our handy CO<sup>2</sup> calculator below!<br></p>
